Hello, world!

I am an [Offensive Security Certified Professional](https://www.credly.com/badges/924302ad-99cf-4aaf-9d68-a317c4444f96/public_url) and [Certified Scrum Master](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/smekhonosh).

I have spent over 10 years working closely with engineering teams at different scale, from greenfield startups to hypergrowth profitable companies.
Software, Security and Management expertise lets me foresee issues and improve engineering processes in advance.
That includes both hands-on technical and overall engineering culture audit.

Today I help companies to transform their engineering processes in order to effectively achieve their goals.
